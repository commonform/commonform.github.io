			<h1>Common Form</h1>
			<p class=subtitle>composable, verifiable, shareable legal contracts</p>
      <p>
        Common Form is a computer language for legal forms.
        It allows software to express not just legal text, but the sections, references, definitions, and placeholders that give it structure.
        Programs that speak Common Form can work together to solve problems word processors and document assemblers can’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the language of Common Form and <a href='https://github.com/commonform'>computer code to use it</a> are licensed, free of charge, on highly permissive, professionally drafted open-source terms.
        The code is neatly divided into small building blocks that are easy to reuse in other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href='https://github.com/orgs/commonform/people'>The Common Form team</a> has written some programs to show a bit of what’s possible.
        You can see them working together at <a href=https://commonform.org>commonform.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common Form is under active development.
